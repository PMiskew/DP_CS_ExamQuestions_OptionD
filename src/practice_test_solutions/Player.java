 * 
 * Responses to questions from test. 
 * 
 * 1.  What is the difference between a class and an object?
 * 
 * 		A class is a blueprint used to create an instance of the class.  The
 * 		instance of the class is the object.  One class can be used to make 
 *		many objects.  For example, the blueprints to make a bike are the class
 *		and any bike built using the blueprints is an object. 
 *
 * 2. What is the differnce between a call to a class (static) method an an instance  method?
 * 	
 * 		A class/static method does not need an implied object.  This means that when calling 
 * 		a class/static method you use the name of the class.  For example the pow method in 
 * 		in the Math class is a static class/method, which means to invoke it we use: 
 * 
 * 		Math.pow(1,2);
 * 
 * 		However, the substring method in the String class is a non-static method meaning we 
 * 		need an instance to call it.  For example String.substring(3,4) is invalid since 
 * 		we don't know what stirng is being acted on.  To use substring you must use a String
 * 		to invoke it. For example
 * 
 * 		String word = "tower";
 * 		word.substring(0,4);
 * 
 * 		Static methods can not access non-static fields or methods.
 * 
 * 3. What is encpasulation?  What is it used?
 * 
 * 		Encapsulation is the process of protecting fields and methods using the private
 * 		or protected modifier.  These limit who can access the fields or methods.  With 
 * 		fields this is particularly useful because all error checking can be done inside
 * 		the method by using get or set methods that manage access.  This means updating
 * 		code is significanly simplified and a when sharing a piece of code that is developed
 * 		all users will have the same restrictions. 
 *
